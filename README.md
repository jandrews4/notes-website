# notes-website
website to store notes

This is a notes website to run this you will need the following libraries:
-base python (3.6 or higher)
-flask (pip install flask)
-sqlalchemy (pip install sqlalchemy)
-an operating system with a file path (literally any operating system you're reading this on)
-werkzeug.security

Everything else is self contained within the website's files. 

To change the notification messages change the first text in the flash function. 

To change any of the text on the pages go into the page.html and edit it to say what you please.

If you add more webpages do NOT forget to work in views.py and auth.py

To run this website with a .com and such you will need a hosting service and registered domain name
(I recommend GoDaddy for this)
